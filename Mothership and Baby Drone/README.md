# Mothership Baby Drone System for Long-Endurance Autonomous Missions and Confined-Space Operations

- Due to its involvement in the defense sector, I am unable to share detailed information about the drone system, as it is protected under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with my previous company. However, I would be glad to share the broader motivation and vision behind the project. The video below offers a clear glimpse into its core concept and operational intent.
  
- My primary role involved developing and integrating perception, navigation, and mapping systems on the drone, enabling it to autonomously detect and track military assets using onboard AI models.
