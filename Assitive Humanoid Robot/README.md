# 3D-Printed Humanoid Robot with Modular End Effectors & Autonomous Support Cart

- Based on the open-source Poppy Project, this humanoid robot is tailored for medical and at home care applications.

- Enhanced with modular end effectors, including flexible grippers, pinching hands, and medical tool manipulators for tasks like item retrieval and vital sign monitoring.

- Uses a magnetic wrist + pogo pin interface for secure end effector mounting with automatic electrical connection.

- End effectors are housed in a rotating tool swapping station, inspired by CNC tool changers, for autonomous switching.

- A companion autonomous cart supports the robot with storage, end effector swapping, a transport platform, and a future ready sensor/elevator bay.

- The cart features a mecanum wheel drivetrain for omnidirectional movement in confined medical or domestic environments.

- Significant mechanical redesign for DFMA, improved torque, joint strength, and fracture resistance in arm and wrist components.

- System is open-source and fully 3D printable, enabling customization for various use cases and accessibility in low-resource settings.

- Modular design encourages community-driven expansion of specialized end effectors for new applications.

- Aims to assist healthcare workers by automating auxiliary tasks, improving efficiency and patient quality of care.
