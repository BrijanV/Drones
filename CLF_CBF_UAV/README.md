# CLF-CBF-QP UAV Obstacle Avoidance 

- Implemented a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) based Quadratic Programming (QP) controller for UAV obstacle avoidance.

- Designed for a 2D planar UAV model operating in both static and dynamic environments.

- Utilized time-varying CBFs (TVCBFs) to improve responsiveness to moving obstacles and maintain safety margins.

- Conducted simulation trials in sparse to densely crowded scenarios to assess control performance and system stability.

- Performed extensive parameter tuning of CBF/CLF weights to optimize robustness under varied task complexity.

- Demonstrated real-time safe navigation with high fidelity to desired trajectories, even under high-density obstacle fields.

- Validated the controller under computational constraints, confirming its potential for embedded hardware deployment.

- Showed that CLF-CBF-QP framework can balance stability, safety, and reactivity in real-time flight control.

- Highlighted potential for integration with higher level global planners and robust state estimators in future work.

- Opened pathways for applying this framework to real UAV platforms, with a focus on scalable, safe autonomy in cluttered spaces.
